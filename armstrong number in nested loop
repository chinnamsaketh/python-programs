A number N is an Armstrong Number, if the sum of each digit to the power of Lis equal to N. Where L is the count of digits in N.

For example if the given number N = 153,

There are 3 (L3) digits in 153 are 1, 2, 3.

The sum of each digit in 153 to the power of 3 is,

Sum (13)+(53) +(33)=1+125 + 27 = 153

The sum of each digit in 153 to the power of 3 is equal to 153.

So, 153 is an Armstrong Number.
Write a nested loop program in python

a=int(input())
for i in range(1,a+1):
    sum=0
    i=str(i)
    power=len(i)
    for j in i:
        j=int(j)
        sum=sum+(j**power)
    i=int(i)
    armst=sum==i
    if armst:
        print(i)
